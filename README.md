# Overview

This contains a collection of projects that can be done by students
learning to work with electronics and microcontrollers such as the
[Raspberry Pi Pico] (https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/).
These usually contain the source code which can copied into Thonny and
then saved on the Pico. Then a layout where the student can properly wire
up everything.

# Development Environment

I've been able to do these projects with the [Thonny IDE] (https://thonny.org/)
and [Visual Studio Code] (https://code.visualstudio.com/). The layout drawings
where done with [Fritzing] (https://fritzing.org/)

# Useful Websites

These are website that I used to help create the sources and layout for
each project.
